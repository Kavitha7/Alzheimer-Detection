### **Problem Definition:**

Alzheimer is the most known causes of dementia. It takes 2/3 of the whole dementia population.

Before I start, I'll have to explain a bit more about the Alzheimer, because, the data contains 4 classes of Alzheimer that depends on the severity of dementia.

There are degrees of severity in Alzheimer.

1. Very mildly demented : This is the stage where patients start to forget where they put their stuff, other people's names etc. It is hard to detect through cognitive ability test.

2. Mildly demented : This is the stage where patients don't remember the words, can't find their way to the destination, loss of focus and work-abilities. This is also the stage where patients even forget that they are losing memory. 

3. Moderately demented : Patients start to forget the recent activities, important old histories, have hard time calculating the budget, hard to go outside alone, and loss of empathy.

There are 3 more stages in the moderate dementia and in the terminal stage, the patients can't move on their own, while they lose the ability to speak.

If these stages are detected faster, then the treatment will have higher effect in terms of slowing the process. 

As Alzheimer can not only be found with cognitive ability testing, but also through MRI or CT by looking at the ventricles of the brain and cortical atrophy. Doctors find that the patient with Alzheimer's has a brain that has enlarged ventricles (that lies in the center of the brain) as well as thinner cortical grey area.

### **Objective:** 

To classify MRI images used for Alzheimer detection as "Mild demented", "Very mild demented", "Moderate demented" and "Non demented" using Support Vector Machines.

### **Analysis:**

Data analysis involves following steps.
1. Understanding the data.
2. Exploratory data analysis.
3. Data preprocessing.
4. Model building
